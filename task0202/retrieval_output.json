Administration of metformin potently limits infarct size in murine models of myocardial infarction . This study examined , for the first time in humans , whether metformin limits ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury in vivo using a well-validated forearm model of endothelial IR-injury . Twenty-eight healthy volunteers ( age @ years , @ male/@ female ) were randomized between pretreatment with metformin ( @ mg three times a day for @ days ) or no treatment in a Prospective Randomized Open Blinded Endpoint study . Brachial artery flow mediated dilation ( FMD ) was measured before and after @ minutes of forearm ischemia and @ minutes of reperfusion . FMD analysis was performed offline by investigators blinded for the treatment arm . Baseline FMD did not differ between metformin pretreatment and no pretreatment ( @ % and @ % , respectively , p = @ , n = @ ) . FMD was significantly lower after forearm IR in both treatment arms ( @ % and @ % , respectively , P < @ in both conditions ) . A linear mixed model analysis revealed that metformin treatment did not prevent the decrease in FMD by IR . A @ day treatment with metformin in healthy , middle-aged subjects does not protect against endothelial IR-injury , measured with brachial artery FMD after forearm ischemia . Further studies are needed to clarify what mechanism underlies the cardiovascular benefit of metformin treatment .",

In addition to the average blood glucose concentration , glycemic variability may be an important factor for the development of chronic diabetes complications . Patients with T@DM are treated with various types of oral glucose-lowering drugs . Exercise is considered to benefit the health of both healthy and unhealthy individuals , which has been confirmed by a number of scientific research studies in which the participants ' health improved . Our general aim in this study will be to evaluate glucose variability after submaximal exercise test in patients receiving treatment with either vildagliptin or glibenclamide . The specific aims of this study are to evaluate the oxidative stress , endothelial function , and metabolic and cardiovascular responses to exercise under treatment with vildagliptin or glibenclamide . All these responses are important in patients with T@DM . This study is a PROBE ( Prospective , Randomized , Open-label , Blinded-Endpoint ) design clinical trial . The estimated sample needed is @ patients with T@DM . In addition to the routine treatment ( metformin ) , patients will receive a second drug orally for @ weeks : the METV group will receive metformin plus vildagliptin ( @ mg twice daily ) , and the METG group will receive metformin plus glibenclamide ( @ to @ mg twice daily . ) Before and after intervention , evaluation of glycemic variability , endothelial function , oxidative stress , and metabolic and cardiovascular response will be performed at rest , during and after a submaximal exercise test ( @ minutes , with an intensity based at @ % under the heart rate at the second threshold ) . In addition to drug treatment , exercise is recommended for treatment of glycemic control in patients with T@DM , especially for its beneficial effects on blood glucose and HbA@c . Few studies have determined the effects of the association between exercise and oral glucose-lowering drugs . The study will be conducted to assess the metabolic and cardiovascular responses at rest , and during and after submaximal exercise in patients receiving one of two oral glucose-lowering drugs ( vildagliptin or glibenclamide ) .",

After treatment , triacylglycerols ( TAGs ) of a relatively higher carbon number showed a clearly increased trend in metformin group compared with the glipizide group , whereas the changes in TAGs with different double bonds were minimal .
